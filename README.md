# Dockerfile Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images from a Dockerfile. The primary problem involves handling dependencies and ensuring that commands are executed correctly within the image's environment. The solution shows how to correctly manage dependencies and execute commands to resolve the build failure.

## Bug Description

The provided Dockerfile attempts to build an image that includes a Python application. However, due to potential issues such as missing dependencies in the base image, or improper execution of commands like `pip3 install`, the Docker build process will fail.  This results in an error during image creation.  The exact error message will depend on the cause of the failure.

## Solution

The `Dockerfile_solution` provides a corrected approach with a focus on using a suitable base image, proper dependency management, and efficient command execution. This ensures a successful image build.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to build the original `Dockerfile` using `docker build -t my-app .`
3. Observe the build failure and the reported error messages.
4. Compare it with the `Dockerfile_solution`'s build.
